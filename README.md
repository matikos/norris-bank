This is a simple app using api full of Chuck Norris jokes and we know these never get old, right?

On the Home screen you have 2 buttons:
- "Random" will get you as many jokes as you can handle. One at the time.
- "Search Joke" will take you to a screen with customized jokes.

On the Custom Name screen you following:
- text input field marked " Full Name" where you input first and second name separated by space.
- "Search" button that will return Chuck Norris joke with name from the input suplanting that of the legend.
- "Home" button that will take you to Home screen.

Jokes are courtesy of http://www.icndb.com


If not for Chuck Norris this app would be much better had it not taken 4s for chuck Norris to do infinity loop.



Below are the boilerplate react app intructions.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
